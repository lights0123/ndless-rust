# Sample projects
There's a few examples of ndless programs written in Rust. See the [example-nspire] repository for some generic examples. Additionally, the [n-89] and [n-flashcards] projects are written in Rust. Note that these may contain older methods of writing code. This book and the API documents of the [various ndless-rs crates][ndless-rs] are the most up-to-date sources of information.
