# Installing

This project has several requirements. Specifically, it requires:
- An up-to-date nightly Rust build (nightly-2020-05-31 works). It's
  recommended to install via rustup.
- `cargo-ndless` and `cargo-generate` (install via `cargo install
  cargo-make cargo-generate`)
- The ndless toolchain installed

The following dependencies will be automatically installed when building
a project:
- The `rust-src` component from `rustup`
