# About
This project was created by [Ben Schattinger] ([GitHub][lights0123]) as an easier way to write Ndless apps for the TI-Nspire. I was frustrated with [the odd parts][rule-of-three] [of C and C++][freetype/Makefile] and the need to remember to manually `free` memory.

Feel free to improve [this book][ndless-rust] by submitting a Pull Request. Feel free to any questions by [opening an issue][ndless-rs-issues] on the [ndless-rs] repository.
