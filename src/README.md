# Introduction

The TI-Nspire has many options for writing programs. The calculator officially supports Lua, and
Ndless programs are typically written in C or C++. This project aims to add Rust to that list of
supported languages.

## What is Ndless?

[Ndless] is a popular program written for the TI-Nspire, which allows running arbitrary code,
bypassing TI's restrictions. It has a complete toolchain for compiling, linking, and packaging
TI-Nspire programs.
